INSTALLATION
------------

Ideally, use the CPANPLUS or CPAN shell (`cpanp` or `cpan`) to download and
install the latest distribution from your nearest CPAN.

To install it manually type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

Or, if you prefer to use make:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
